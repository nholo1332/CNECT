## App Icon

Our app logo was formed as a way to depict the connection created between the local professionals and their communities. The app icon is similar to a compass, with its four points representing the four cardinal directions.


## About

We created CNECT as a way to make it easier for local professionals to connect with businesses in their community. Our app is all about connections, which led us to the name of CNECT (pronounced "connect"). There are many social media applications available that aim to help professionals, but our app targets a new way of doing so - involving the community. The community around you is what builds support for not only yourself and your business, but creates unity within the community and leads to success.


Our app was submitted to the 2020-2021 Nebraska FBLA State Leadership Conference (SLC) and was awarded 1st place. Due to the nature of the 2021 National Leadership Conference (NLC), we, as a team, decided to submit our inidividual projects for NLC instead of this project. Sadly, this brings the end to the development of this app project, but we had fun developing, testing, and submitting our project.

## How To Use

To clone and run this backend service, you will need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install), and Xcode (for iOS) installed on your computer. Next, run these commands:

```bash
# Clone this repository (or download the file from GitHub)
$ git clone https://github.com/nholo1332/CNECT.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd CNECT

# Install dependencies
$ flutter pub get

# Run the development app
$ flutter run
```
Make sure you have a supported device connected that is trusted on your computer. If you need to use a simulator, use Android Studio, or test on iOS using the commands below:
```
# Build for iOS
$ flutter build --ios
```
Then, open Xcode and navigate to the project to open the `Runner.xcworkspace`. From there, select your target device and click run.


## Why Flutter?

There are many platforms that allow cross-platform (non-native) development, so why did we choose Flutter?
* Devlopment Speed
  - Flutter has hot reload, so once you make a change and save it, the app will automatically reload and your changes are visible almost instantly.
* Two App at Once
  - When writing code, we write it for both Android and iOS at the same time - dramatically cutting down on development time.
* Customization
  - Flutter allows for easily creating your own widgets to make creative and unique designs.
* Compatibility
  - Because Flutter creates its own widgets, the app will look the same on all devices, regardless of age.
* Expanding Support
  - Flutter has also caught the eye of many other developers. This helps the Flutter ecosystem as more developers mean more awesome dependencies available to us.


## Credits

All dependencies can be found in the `pubspec.yaml` file. All licenses can be found on the licenses view in the app.
